% The goal is to find the largest Euclidean ball (i.e. its center and radius) 
% that lies in a polyhedron described by linear inequalites in this
% fashion: P = {x : a_i'*x <= b_i, i=1,...,m} where x is in R^2
% Generate the input data
a1 = [ 2; 1]; a2 = [ 2; -1]; a3 = [-1; 2]; a4 = [-1; -2]; b = ones(4,1);
